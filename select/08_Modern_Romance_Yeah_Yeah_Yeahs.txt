Don't hold on
And go get strong
Well, don't you know
That there is no
Modern romance
Time
Time is gone
It stops, stops who it wants
Well, I was wrong
It never lasts
And there is no
Well, this is no
Modern romance
And time
Time is gone
It never lasts
Stops who it wants
Well, I was wrong
It never lasts
This is no
There is no
Modern romance
There is no modern romance
This is no...modern romance
There is no, there is no....
[Long pause]
Baby I'm afraid of a lot of things
But I ain't scared of loving you
Baby I know your afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared of love
'Cause people will say all kinds of things
That don't mean a damn to me
'Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well, I've been dragged all over the place
I've taken hits time just don't erase
And baby I can see you've been fucked with too
But that don't mean your loving days are through
'Cause people will say all kinds of things
That don't mean a damn to me
'Cause all I see is what's in front of me
And that's you
Well I may be just a fool
But I know were just as cool
And cool kids they belong together
